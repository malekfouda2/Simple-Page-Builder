## Security Features Verified

### API Key Security
- ✅ Cryptographically secure generation using `random_bytes(32)`
- ✅ Hashing with `wp_hash_password()` (bcrypt)
- ✅ Timing-safe comparison with `wp_check_password()`
- ✅ One-time display after generation
- ✅ No plaintext storage

### Input Sanitization
- ✅ `sanitize_text_field()` for text inputs
- ✅ `wp_kses_post()` for HTML content
- ✅ `esc_url_raw()` for URLs
- ✅ `intval()` for integers

## Performance Considerations

✅ **Database Indexing:** All tables have proper indexes on frequently queried columns  
✅ **Caching:** Rate limiting uses WordPress transients (caching layer)  
✅ **Query Optimization:** Uses wpdb->prepare for efficient query execution  
✅ **Asset Loading:** Admin assets only loaded on plugin admin pages  

---

## Known Limitations (Not Errors)

The LSP (Language Server Protocol) may show warnings for WordPress functions because the PHP language server doesn't have WordPress loaded. These are NOT real errors:

- `plugin_dir_path()` - WordPress core function
- `register_activation_hook()` - WordPress core function
- `add_action()` - WordPress core function
- `get_option()` - WordPress core function
- etc.

These functions are all part of WordPress core and will work correctly when the plugin is installed in a WordPress environment.
