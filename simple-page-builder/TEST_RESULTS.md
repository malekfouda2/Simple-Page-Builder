## Security Features Verified

### API Key Security
- Cryptographically secure generation using `random_bytes(32)`
- Hashing with `wp_hash_password()` (bcrypt)
- Timing-safe comparison with `wp_check_password()`
- One-time display after generation
- No plaintext storage

### Input Sanitization
- `sanitize_text_field()` for text inputs
- `wp_kses_post()` for HTML content
- `esc_url_raw()` for URLs
- `intval()` for integers
- `sanitize_key()` for meta keys
- `sanitize_title()` for slugs

### Output Escaping
- `esc_html()` for HTML output
- `esc_attr()` for HTML attributes
- `esc_url()` for URLs in HTML

### Authentication & Authorization
- API key validation on every request
- Rate limiting per API key
- Admin capability checks (`manage_options`)
- WordPress nonces for AJAX requests
- Expiration date support

### Webhook Security
- HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- Timing-safe signature verification (`hash_equals`)
- Secret key generation
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Timeout protection (10 seconds)

### Database Security
- Prepared statements for SQL queries
- Proper character set and collation
- Indexed columns for performance
- No direct SQL concatenation

- includes/class-spb-database.php
- includes/class-spb-api-keys.php
- includes/class-spb-rate-limiter.php
- includes/class-spb-activity-logger.php
- includes/class-spb-webhook.php
- includes/class-spb-rest-api.php
- admin/class-spb-admin.php

### Assets (2)

- assets/js/admin.js


### Testing (3)
- validate.php
- tests/test-plugin.php
- tests/test-security.php

## Performance Considerations

✅ **Database Indexing:** All tables have proper indexes on frequently queried columns  
✅ **Caching:** Rate limiting uses WordPress transients (caching layer)  
✅ **Query Optimization:** Uses wpdb->prepare for efficient query execution  
✅ **Asset Loading:** Admin assets only loaded on plugin admin pages

## Known Limitations (Not Errors)

The LSP (Language Server Protocol) may show warnings for WordPress functions because the PHP language server doesn't have WordPress loaded. These are NOT real errors:

- `plugin_dir_path()` - WordPress core function
- `register_activation_hook()` - WordPress core function
- `add_action()` - WordPress core function
- `get_option()` - WordPress core function
- etc.

These functions are all part of WordPress core and will work correctly when the plugin is installed in a WordPress environment.
